## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository bootstrap: Go module, `locklog version`, CI (tests on Linux,
  macOS and Windows; hygiene, gofmt, vet, staticcheck, govulncheck).
- Configuration: `.locklog/config.toml` profiles (version 1) with file,
  journald, docker and Loki sources, masking modes, budgets and their
  ceilings, production rules, and the policy diff that marks every
  loosening for the console's review.
- The image (`ghcr.io/davidgodefroid/locklog`, accounts 10050-10052, `-vault`
  variant), the host launcher `scripts/locklog` (the console's confinement
  and read-only, non-recursive mount plan checked on the host; `mcp` as the
  agent account; `update`, `version`), `scripts/install.sh` (cosign-verified
  archive and image, root-owned launcher, snapshot release bases), and the
  release workflow (draft, signed images, anonymous pull, publish, pages).
- Egress for remote sources: an HTTP client pinned to the configured host
  and port (no proxy, no redirects, link-local addresses refused), the Loki
  read-only allowlist checked segment by segment, response caps, the tls
  modes, and the production check that refuses a backend answering a data
  read without credentials.
- The console (`locklog console`): the agent's log methods served through
  lockkit's console over a seam to the engine, the launcher's checks
  before any log is read (dev:inode of `.locklog` and of each mount root;
  no network for a local-only profile), an audit record per call written
  before the answer leaves (fail closed; never a predicate or a value), and
  `--allowed-uids`.
- The MCP server (`locklog mcp`): `locklog_status`, `locklog_sources`,
  `locklog_search`, `locklog_count`, the PII rules and change requests, each
  a thin adapter over the console; a host agent (the launcher's `mcp`) is
  refused on production profiles, as the console's status reports them,
  with the structured refusal `E_PRODUCTION_HOST_AGENT` (and when the
  status does not say: the guard fails closed). Its status tool never
  shows that profile's status, and no tool's structured output carries
  more than its text. Inputs are bounded by their schemas; integers
  beyond 2^53 come back as decimal strings. The PII tools answer once
  the console serves PII rules.
  `locklog init <agent>` wires Claude Code, Codex, Cursor or Gemini CLI;
  for Claude Code it merges the free tools (never an approved one such as
  `locklog_request_change`) into the project's `.claude/settings.local.json`
  `permissions.allow`, keeping the human's entries; the shared
  `.claude/settings.json` and the user's own settings are never written.
  A re-run adds back the entries the human removed, and prints each entry
  it added (`added to permissions.allow in .claude/settings.local.json:
  <entry>`); remove an entry again to be asked for it. init warns when git
  does not ignore `.claude/settings.local.json`.
- The Docker source: containers' `json-file` logs (rotated `.N[.gz]` files
  included) read by name from the containers root through a name → id map,
  approved globs checked again at read time, console containers never served,
  no read across a mount point; the `docker-json` format with an `attrs`
  allowlist. The launcher binds the containers root with gid 0, keeps the map
  current with a `docker events` loop, labels console containers, and gains
  `locklog refresh`. gid 0 applies to the whole console, so a docker source
  runs in a console of its own: the mount plan and the launcher refuse it
  beside a file or journald source.
- `internal/landlock`: a Landlock ruleset the console applies to itself
  (read-only beneath the log and containers roots, writes only to its
  volumes and /tmp, rights chosen by ABI), and the rule that a docker source
  on a production profile needs Landlock or openat2 with `RESOLVE_NO_XDEV`.
- Parsing: the `syslog` (RFC 5424 with structured data, RFC 3164 with or
  without PRI, rsyslog's RFC 3339 variant) and `combined` (NCSA
  common/combined access logs) formats, detected by `auto` after JSON and
  logfmt, and the `cri` and `docker-json` container frames (runtime time,
  stream, split lines joined, payload decoded with `auto`).
- Masking on lockkit v0.8.0: its secret detector (credentials, token
  shapes, private keys, URL userinfo) and `LooksSecret` names are step 1,
  always on and never a profile setting (`detectors = ["secret"]` is
  refused); public IP addresses (`ip`) join the default detectors;
  `person_name` and `phone_loose` are opt-in by naming them in a profile's
  `detectors`.

### Fixed

- The launcher chooses the non-recursive bind option from the Docker CLI
  version, which parses it (`bind-recursive=disabled` from CLI 25), not from
  the engine's.
